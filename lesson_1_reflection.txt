How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The plus and minus signs showed the differences between the two.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps you see the changes youâ€™ve made to previous forms of your file, and act accordingly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I think it makes sense since the user knows when he wants a change to be recorded and will be able to look back and view the history accordingly which would be convenient.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A change may sometimes affect multiple files collectively. Hence, Git allows for this.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log gives a summary of all the changes that were made. Git diff helps compare the difference between two of the changes/commits made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can refer to the log, and checkout different commits, and see if the code works in the desired manner.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To view the different changes made to this file, perhaps.
